# Pangolin Staking Positions and Pango Chef

Pangolin Staking Positions and Pango Chef are unique staking and farming solutions. They utilize
the Sunshine and Rainbows (SAR) algorithm, which distributes rewards as a function of balance and
staking duration.

## Sunshine And Rainbows (üåû,üåà)

Sunshine and Rainbows is a novel staking algorithm. In SAR, rewards at a given interval are
distributed based on the formula below.

$$
\text{reward proportion} = \frac{\text{position staked balance}}{\text{total staked balance}} \times \frac{\text{position staking duration}}{\text{average staking duration}}
$$

[The proof section at the end](#sar-proof) describes how this formula is used to derive an algorithm
that can calculate rewards in *O(1)*.

### Rationale

SAR aims to reduce the selling pressure on the reward token, reward loyal users, allow leveraging
of loyalty, and discourage dumping. And do all of that without having to lock staked tokens, and
without enabling predatory middlemen protocols (e.g.: Curve wars protocols).

## Staking Duration

Staking duration is the unique factor in SAR when determining the reward proportion of a position.
There are three basic rules for determining the staking duration of a staked token. Staking
duration (1) starts with staking, (2) restarts with harvesting, and (3) ends with withdrawing.

In core SAR, there are three important mutative user functions: `stake`, `harvest`,
 and `withdraw`. Depending on their effect to the staking duration, these functions can be
considered as destructive/devaluing üî¥ or constructive üü¢. The effects of calling these
function to the staking duration are described below.

* üü¢ `stake(amount)`:
  * The existing staked balance of the position preserves its staking duration.
  * The staking duration of the newly staked tokens starts from zero.
* üî¥ `harvest()`:
  * The staking duration for all the staked tokens of the position restarts.
  This is because `harvest` call claims all the accrued rewards of a position. It is not possible
  to claim only the rewards of a portion of one's staked balance. One can either claim it all
  or none. Note that one can have an implementation where this can be circumvented, but in all
  the implementations we wrote, partial harvesting is not possible, so we will go with this
  specification.
* üî¥ `withdraw(amount)`:
  * The staking duration for all the staked balance of the position restarts.
  This is because when withdrawing, all the accrued rewards are harvested. So, even if not the
  whole balance is withdrawn, all the rewards are harvested, which in turn restarts the staking
  duration of any remaining balance.

## Implementations

In this repository, there are two implementations of SAR algorithm.

### `PangolinStakingPositions`

[`PangolinStakingPositions`](./PangolinStakingPositions.sol) is a single-sided staking solution in
which both the staking and reward tokens are the same token (i.e.: PNG). The rewards come from AMM
revenue. The revenue tokens get converted to PNG through `FeeCollector` (`SushiMaker` equivalent),
and then PNG is added to `PangolinStakingPositions` as reward. In this implementation of SAR, we also
track positions instead of users, which allows leveraging the NFT technology.

This implementation allows us to add an extra `compound()` (üü¢) function to the core SAR
functions. This function makes no external calls because the reward and staking tokens are the
same. Note that the compounding function is not just for convenience, it is also a way to bypass restarting the staking duration by calling `harvest()` (üî¥).

* üü¢ `compound()`:
  * Harvests and re-stakes the accrued rewards without restarting the staking duration,
  * The staking duration of the newly staked tokens starts from zero.

Since all positions are NFTs, this implementation opens the door for derivatives. This would allow
stakers to ‚Äúleverage their loyalty‚Äù. Because a position which has double the staking duration than
average would also have double the APR. This would render such a position more valuable than the
amount of PNG it holds.

However, due to lack of standardized slippage control for NFTs, mutable NFTs can be frontrun on
secondary marketplaces. To alleviate this issue we simply disable spending approvals for an NFT
for a short period following a destructive action (e.g.: `withdraw()`). This prevents secondary
marketplaces from executing `transferFrom()` function of NFTs to process the trade. So if a seller
tries to frontrun a buyer by withdrawing the staked balance from the NFT position, the transaction
will revert.

`PangolinStakingPositions` is written specifically for PNG, which has a total supply of
`230_000_000e18`, and reverts on failed transactions.

### `PangoChef`

[`PangoChef`](./PangoChef.sol) is a MiniChef analogue that uses SAR algorithm.

In this implementation, there can be infinite amount of pools which separately utilize the SAR
algorithm. So each pool has its own total staked balance and average staking duration.

PangoChef distributes global rewards to pools based on Synthetix‚Äôs staking algorithm, such that
pool operations and updating rewards stays in constant time as the number of pools increase. Then each
pool separately utilizes the SAR algorithm to distribute its reward allocation to users.

PangoChef requires a Uniswap V2 factory and a wrapped native token address to be defined in
the constructor. Although it accepts any ERC20 token to be staked, it is mainly intended for
Pangolin liquidity pool tokens.

PangolinStakingPosition had a simple compounding mechanism. In PangoChef, compounding requires
that (1) pool‚Äôs staking token is a liquidity pool pair token of the factory defined in the
constructor, and (2) one of the tokens in the pair is `rewardsToken`. Given these requirements are satisfied for a pool,
compounding works as follows.

* üü¢ `compound()`:
  * Harvests rewards without resetting the staking duration of the user of the pool,
  * Transfers equivalent amount of the pair of the rewards token from user‚Äôs wallet to the contract,
  * Pairs the rewards token and the token supplied by the user to create the staking token by adding liquidity to pair,
  * Stakes the newly minted liquidity pool receipt tokens to the pool,
  * The staking duration of the newly staked tokens starts from zero.

Another version of compounding is also possible for any ERC20 pool. In this version, harvested rewards
from any pool are paired with wrapped version of the native gas token, and staked to pool zero. In
PangoChef, pool zero (`poolId == 0`) is reserved for `WRAPPED_NATIVE_TOKEN-REWARDS_TOKEN` liquidity
pool token, and it is created during construction.

* üü¢ `compoundToPoolZero()`:
  * Harvests rewards without resetting the staking duration of the user of the pool,
  * Transfers equivalent amount of native gas token from user‚Äôs wallet to the contract,
  * Pairs the rewards token and the wrapped version of the native gas token to create the staking token of pool zero,
  * Stakes the newly minted liquidity pool receipt tokens to the pool zero,
  * The staking duration of the newly staked tokens starts from zero,
  * A lock is created on pool zero.

Compounding to pool zero requires a locking mechanism to prevent gaming of the system. Without locking, a user could
compound to pool zero, then withdraw their principal from pool zero right away. This means that rewards of a pool is
harvested and transferred to user‚Äôs wallet without the user‚Äôs staking duration getting reset. This defeats the purpose of SAR.
Locking works in the following manner to prevent this issues.

To elaborate the locking mechanism, when pool A rewards are compounded to pool zero, the user‚Äôs lock count on pool zero is
incremented by one, only if pool A did not already have a lock on pool zero. When user harvests or
withdraws from pool A, the user‚Äôs lock count on pool zero is decremented by one, only if pool A
was locking it. For a user to harvest or withdraw from pool zero, the user‚Äôs lock count on pool
zero should be zero. In another example, if a user compounds the rewards of pool A, B, and C to pool zero, the user‚Äôs
lock count will be three. The user will only be able to withdraw or harvest from pool zero after
they withdraw or harvest at least once from all of those three pools. This mechanism ensures the principle of
**rewards of a pool must not leave the contract without the pool‚Äôs staking duration getting reset**.
Violation of this principle would be a critical vulnerability. Another major bug would be the lock count
getting stuck at non-zero without a way to bring it back to zero again.

Another feature of PangoChef is rewarder. Rewarder is an external contract that can be defined
for any pool. Rewarder allows distributing extra token rewards. One issue with Rewarder is that
it can allow a malicious owner to create DOS on withdraw functions. To prevent this, usually
there is an emergency exit function that lacks the rewarder hook. We did not want to have an exit
function lacking the rewarder hook, because that prohibits time-based rewarders (as opposed to
multiplier-based rewarders). By exiting without a hook, users can trick rewarder that they are
still staking, hence they can accrue rewards that they do not deserve. As a solution both to the
DOS on exit by rewarder, and user‚Äôs gaming a time-based rewarder, we decided to add a low-level
call to rewarder in emergency exit. Low-level calls do not cause revert if the external contract
call reverts. So that should solve both the issues.

Yet another feature of PangoChef is relayer pools. That is an alternative type of pool to ERC20 pools,
and the only purpose of the pool is to divert its share of rewards to a single address. This can
allow us to divert emissions to partners, or have a separate contract that manages ERC721 staking.

`PangoChef` is mainly written for PangolinPair tokens. The total staked amount limit of
`type(uint104).max` is likely to be sufficient for most pair tokens. Weird tokens (rebasing tokens,
fee-on-transfer tokens, and quintillion-supply meme tokens) are not supported.

## Notes on Unchecked Math, Truncation, and Overflow

We are aware that solc does not check for truncation when type casting. The code is deliberately
written such that either by input sanitization, or by basic assumptions about current timestamp,
there should be no truncation. The same reasoning goes for the use of unchecked blocks.

As an example regarding input sanitization, there is a limit of `type(uint96).max` on total
rewards that can be added. This limit is *unlikely* to be reached (*unlikely*, because even
though PNG supply fits 96 bits, the limit can theoretically be reached by rewards getting cycled
back to the contract), but it allows us to determine for certain or only with assumptions about
`block.timestamp`, that calculations cannot overflow.

Note that when using unchecked math, we only make assumptions about `block.timestamp`, the
remaining values used in calculations must have a hard limit checked through input sanitization,
hence they become limitations, and should no longer be considered as assumptions. With that, we can
have a single assumption that `block.timestamp` fits 32 bits (until `Sun 07 Feb 2106 06:28:15 AM UTC`).
However, given normal operations of the contract, we should be fine for many thousand years to
come without any major risk of overflow.

We also use an uncommonly high precision / multiplier / fixed denominator (i.e: `2**128`) for
storing ‚Äúreward summations‚Äù used in the SAR algorithm. The reason for this is that loss of
precision can cause handing out dust amounts of extra rewards to stakers. This is in contrast to
Synthetix‚Äô staking algorithm, where loss of precision would simply result in dust amounts of
fewer rewards getting distributed. When extra rewards are distributed, that can result in the last
participant unable to withdraw unless extra reward tokens are transferred to the contract. This is
perhaps something to be investigated to determine the optimal precision multiplier.

## SAR Proof

### Definitions

Let‚Äôs consider an interval to be the period between two consecutive updates (triggered via `stake`, `withdraw`, or `harvest` events). Given interval $i$, let $B_i$ be the sum of all staked balance, and let $D_i$ be the balance-weighted average staking duration of all staked balance at the end of the interval. When distributing rewards of the interval, $R_i$, a position (or participant) $a$, with staked balance of $b_{a,i}$, and an average staking duration of $d_{a,i}$ at the end of the interval, will earn the following reward amount.

$$
	r_{a,i} = R_i \times \frac{b_{a,i}}{B_i} \times \frac{d_{a,i}}{D_i}
$$

For multiple intervals, during which the position $a$ has a constant staked balance, $b_a$, the position will earn the following total reward amount.

$$
	\sum_i{r_{a,i}} = b_a \times \sum_i{\frac{R_i d_{a,i}}{B_i D_i}}
$$

where $i$ iterates over all the intervals.

### Derivation

We define an interval range, from $j$ to $k$, where $k > j$. This is the range for which we want to compute the rewards of the position. We let the staking duration of the position start at the beginning of interval $j$ (which is also the end of interval $j-1$). Therefore, its staking duration at the end of the interval $i$ is $t_i - t_{j-1}$, where $t_i \geq t_{j-1}$ and $t$ is the duration from epoch to the end of the interval.

$$
	\sum_{i=j}^{k}{r_{a,i}} = b_a \times \sum_{i=j}^{k}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{j-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$


Now we can begin the magic show. First, separate the summation into two parts by expanding $R_i (t_i - t_{j-1})$.

$$
	=  b_a \times \left( \sum_{i=j}^{k}{\frac{R_i t_i}{B_i D_i}} - \sum_{i=j}^{k}{\frac{R_i t_{j-1}}{B_i D_i}} \right)
$$

Second, move the constant $t_{j-1}$ outside the summation.

$$
	= b_a \times \left( \sum_{i=j}^{k}{\frac{R_i t_i}{B_i D_i}} - t_{j-1} \times \sum_{i=j}^{k}{\frac{R_i}{B_i D_i}} \right)
$$

Third, well there is no third. That is all regarding the core algorithm. We are left with two summations that we can increment with each interval. When we want to record the rewards of a position, we can simply record the $t_{j-1}$ time stamp, and take the snapshot of the two summations. Then we can get their delta from the snapshot to the current values of the summations. In the code, we will call the summation on the left the `idealPosition`, and the summation on the right the `rewardPerValue`.

#### Combined Positions

It is also possible to calculate the combined rewards of two positions. However, we can only consider the consecutive intervals during both positions are active. Let‚Äôs look at two position, $a$ and $b$. Position $a$ starts staking at interval $j$ (i.e.: the end of interval $j-1$). Position $b$ starts staking at interval $k$ (i.e.: the end of interval $k-1$). We will derive a formula to calculate the combined rewards from $k$ to $l$ (inclusive range), where $l > k > j$.

$$
	\sum_{i=k}^{l}{(r_{a,i} + r_{b,i})} = b_a \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{j-1})}{B_i D_i}} + b_b \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$

First, rewrite the duration of position $a$ to include the duration of $b$.

$$
	= b_a \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1} + t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})}{B_i D_i}} + b_b \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$

Second, separate the position $a$ summation into two parts by expanding $R_i (t_i - t_{k-1} + t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})$.

$$
	= b_a \times \left( \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})}{B_i D_i}} + \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}} \right) + b_b \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$

Third, merge the rightmost expression inside the parentheses with the summation of position $b$ (notice that the summation is the same).

$$
	= b_a \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})}{B_i D_i}} + (b_a + b_b) \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$

Fourth, move the constant $(t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})$ outside the summation.

$$
	= b_a \times (t_{k-1} - t_{j-1}) \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i }{B_i D_i}} + (b_a + b_b) \times \sum_{i=k}^{l}{\frac{R_i (t_i - t_{k-1})}{B_i D_i}}
$$

That is it. We can then expand the rightmost summation the way we [demonstrated previously](#derivation). And when we are merging positions, we can simply record $b_a \times (t_{k-1} - t_{j-1})$, which we will call `previousValues` in the code.

We can continue combining more positions this way. It only requires incrementing `previousValues`. We will leave proving that as an exercise for the reader.

Thanks for reading. I hope you had fun :3
