 * @title PangoChef Funding

 * @notice A contract that is only the reward funding part of `PangoChef`.
 * @dev The pools of the inheriting contract must call `_claim()` to check their rewards since the
 *      last time they made the same call. Then, based on the reward amount, the pool shall
 *      determine the distribution to stakers. It uses the same algorithm as Synthetix’
 *      StakingRewards, but instead of distributing rewards to stakers based on their staked
 *      amount, it distributes rewards to pools based on arbitrary weights.
